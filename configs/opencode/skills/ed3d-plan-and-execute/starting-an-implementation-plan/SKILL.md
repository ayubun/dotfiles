# Starting an Implementation Plan

## Overview

Orchestrate the transition from design document to executable implementation through planning and execution handoff.

**Core principle:** Branch -> Plan -> Execute. Isolate work, create detailed tasks, hand off to execution.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the starting-an-implementation-plan skill to create the implementation plan from your design."

## REQUIRED: Design Plan Path

**DO NOT GUESS.** If the user has not provided a path to a design plan, you MUST ask for it.

Use the `question` tool:
```
Question: "Which design plan should I create an implementation plan for?"
Options:
  - [list any design plans you find in docs/design-plans/]
  - "Let me provide the path"
```

If `docs/design-plans/` doesn't exist or is empty, ask the user to provide the path directly.

**Never assume, infer, or guess which design plan to use.** The user must explicitly tell you.

## The Process

This skill has three steps:

1. **Branch Setup:** Select and create branch for implementation
2. **Planning:** Create detailed implementation plan
3. **Execution Handoff:** Direct user to execute the plan

**Step 0: Create orchestration task tracker**

Use the `todowrite` tool to track the orchestration steps. The todo list is flat — express ordering by list order and work top to bottom:

```
todowrite:
- "Branch setup"
- (conditional) "Read project implementation guidance from [absolute path]"
  (only if .ed3d/implementation-plan-guidance.md exists; do after Branch setup)
- "Create implementation plan"
  (do after Branch setup — and after reading guidance, if that todo exists)
- "Re-read starting-an-implementation-plan skill (restore context)"
  (do NOT start until ALL granular planning tasks, including Finalization, are complete)
- "Execution handoff"
  (do after Re-read skill)
```

**CRITICAL: The "Re-read skill" todo must end up positioned AFTER the Finalization task that writing-implementation-plans creates.** See "After Planning: Keep Ordering Correct" below.

The "Create implementation plan" task wraps the granular tasks created by writing-implementation-plans. The "Re-read skill" step ensures context is restored after potential compaction before handoff.

### Branch Setup

Mark "Branch setup" task as in_progress.

Before planning, set up the branch and workspace for implementation work.

Extract the **slug** from the design plan filename (everything after `YYYY-MM-DD-`, excluding `.md`). For example, `oauth2-svc-authn` from `2025-01-18-oauth2-svc-authn.md`.

This slug is used for:
1. Implementation plan directory name (`docs/implementation-plans/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}/`)
2. Worktree directory name (`.worktrees/{slug}`)
3. **Scoping all AC identifiers** — every acceptance criterion uses the format `{slug}.AC{N}.{M}`

The slug ensures AC identifiers are globally unique across multiple plan-and-execute rounds.

**Step 1: Ask about worktree**

**REQUIRED: Use the `question` tool**

Ask:
```
Question: "Do you want to use a git worktree for this implementation?"
Options:
  - "Yes - create worktree" (isolated workspace in .worktrees/[friendly-name])
  - "No - work in current directory" (standard branch workflow)
```

**Step 2: Set up workspace based on choice**

**If user chooses "Yes - create worktree":**

1. **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use using-git-worktrees
2. **CONDITIONAL SKILLS:** Activate any project-specific git worktree skills if they exist
3. Announce: "I'm using the using-git-worktrees skill to create an isolated workspace."
4. Ask user which branch to use for the worktree:
   ```
   Question: "Which branch should I use for this worktree?"
   Options:
     - "[friendly-name]" (e.g., oauth2-svc-authn)
     - "$(whoami)/[friendly-name]" (e.g., ed/oauth2-svc-authn)
   ```
5. Create worktree:
   - Default location (unless directed otherwise): `$repoRoot/.worktrees/[friendly-name]`
   - Branch from main/master
   - Follow using-git-worktrees skill for safety verification and setup
6. Change to worktree directory
7. Announce: "Worktree created at `.worktrees/[friendly-name]` on branch `[branch-name]`"

**If user chooses "No - work in current directory":**

1. Ask user which branch to use:
   ```
   Question: "Which branch should I use for this implementation?"
   Options:
     - "Use current branch" (stay on current branch, no branch creation)
     - "[friendly-name]" (e.g., oauth2-svc-authn)
     - "$(whoami)/[friendly-name]" (e.g., ed/oauth2-svc-authn)
   ```
2. **If "Use current branch":** Continue with current branch (no git commands)
3. **If branch name provided:**
   - Determine main branch name: Check if `main` or `master` exists
   - Create new branch from main/master: `git checkout -b [branch-name] origin/[main-or-master]`
   - Verify branch created successfully
   - Announce: "Created and checked out branch `[branch-name]` from `origin/[main-or-master]`"
4. **If branch creation fails:** Report error to user and ask if they want to use current branch instead

Mark "Branch setup" task as completed. **THEN proceed to Planning.**

### Check for Implementation Guidance

After branch setup, check for project-specific implementation guidance.

**Check if `.ed3d/implementation-plan-guidance.md` exists:**

Use the `read` tool to check if `.ed3d/implementation-plan-guidance.md` exists in the session's working directory.

**If the file exists:**

1. Use `todowrite` to add: "Read project implementation guidance from [absolute path to .ed3d/implementation-plan-guidance.md]"
   - Place it after "Branch setup" and before "Create implementation plan" in the todo list — it must complete before planning starts
2. Mark the task in_progress
3. Read the file and incorporate the guidance into your understanding
4. Mark the task completed
5. Proceed to Planning

**If the file does not exist:**

Proceed directly to Planning. Do not create a task or mention the missing file.

**What implementation guidance provides:**
- Coding standards and conventions
- Testing requirements and patterns
- Review criteria beyond defaults
- Project-specific quality gates

### Planning

Mark "Create implementation plan" task as in_progress.

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use writing-implementation-plans

Announce: "I'm using the writing-implementation-plans skill to create the detailed implementation plan."

The writing-implementation-plans skill will:
- Verify scope (<=8 phases from design plan)
- Verify codebase state with investigator
- Create phase-by-phase implementation tasks
- Validate each phase with user before proceeding
- Write implementation plan to `docs/implementation-plans/`

**Output:** Complete implementation plan written to files, on appropriate branch.

Mark "Create implementation plan" task as completed.

### After Planning: Keep Ordering Correct

**CRITICAL: Ensure the "Re-read skill" todo comes after the Finalization task.**

The granular tasks are now created. Rewrite the todo list with `todowrite` so "Re-read skill" and "Execution handoff" are the last two items, after Finalization:

```
✔ Branch setup
✔ Create implementation plan
✔ Phase 1A: Read [Phase Name] from /path/to/design.md
✔ Phase 1B: Investigate codebase for Phase 1
...
✔ Finalization: Run ed3d-code-reviewer...
◻ Re-read skill (after Finalization)
◻ Execution handoff (after Re-read skill)
```

### Restore Context (Before Handoff)

Mark "Re-read starting-an-implementation-plan skill (restore context)" task as in_progress.

**CRITICAL: Re-read this skill before proceeding to handoff.**

After potentially long planning work (especially if context compaction occurred), re-read this skill to ensure you have accurate instructions for the execution handoff: use the `skill` tool to load starting-an-implementation-plan again, or use the `read` tool on this skill's SKILL.md (its absolute path is shown in the file list when this skill loads).

**Why this matters:** After compaction, you may have lost details about the handoff process. Re-reading ensures you provide correct absolute paths and instructions.

Mark "Re-read starting-an-implementation-plan skill" task as completed.

### Execution Handoff

Mark "Execution handoff" task as in_progress.

After planning is complete, hand off to execution.

**Do NOT invoke plan execution directly.** The user needs to start a fresh session first.

**Step 1: Capture and verify absolute paths**

Before outputting the handoff instructions, you MUST run these commands to get real, verified paths:

```bash
# Get absolute path to current working tree root
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
```

Capture this output as `WORKING_ROOT`.

Then construct and verify the implementation plan path exists:

```bash
# Verify implementation plan directory exists
# Replace YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name with the actual plan directory name
ls -d "${WORKING_ROOT}/docs/implementation-plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name"
```

**Both commands must succeed.** If the plan directory doesn't exist, something went wrong during planning — investigate before proceeding.

**Step 2: Provide copy-paste instructions with verified absolute paths**

Use the actual paths you captured and verified in Step 1. Example output:

```
Implementation plan complete!

Ready to execute? This requires fresh context to work effectively.

**IMPORTANT: Copy the message below BEFORE running /new (it will leave this conversation).**

(1) Copy this message now:

Use the executing-an-implementation-plan skill with plan directory /Users/ed/project/.worktrees/oauth2-feature/docs/implementation-plans/2025-01-17-oauth2-feature/ and working directory /Users/ed/project/.worktrees/oauth2-feature/

(2) Start a fresh session:

/new

(3) Paste and run the copied message.

The executing-an-implementation-plan skill will implement the plan task-by-task with code review between tasks.
```

**Use the real paths from Step 1, not placeholders.** The example above shows the format — substitute your actual verified paths.

**Why absolute paths:** A fresh session starts in the original project directory (often the repo root, not the worktree). Absolute paths ensure execution happens in the correct directory regardless of where the new session starts.

**Why a fresh session instead of continuing:**
- Execution needs fresh context to work effectively
- Long conversations accumulate context that degrades quality
- A fresh session gives the execution phase a clean slate

Mark "Execution handoff" task as completed.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Invoking executing-an-implementation-plan directly | Provide copy-paste instructions instead |
| Not warning user to copy the message before /new | Always warn: "Copy this BEFORE running /new" |
| Using relative paths in handoff message | Run bash commands to get absolute paths, verify they exist |
| Outputting placeholder paths like `[WORKING_ROOT]` | Output real paths from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and `ls -d` |
| Not verifying plan directory exists | Always `ls -d` the full plan path before outputting the message |
| Passing phase_01.md instead of directory | Pass the directory so all phases execute |
| Forgetting to mention /new | Always tell user to start a fresh session before executing |
| Skipping "Re-read skill" step before handoff | Always re-read this skill to restore context post-compaction |
| Not creating orchestration tasks at start | Create Branch setup, Planning, Re-read, Handoff todos in Step 0 |
| Leaving "Re-read skill" mis-ordered after planning | It must come after the Finalization task in the todo list, not right after "Create implementation plan" |

## Integration with Workflow

This skill sits between design and execution:

```
Design Plan (in docs/design-plans/)
  -> User invokes this skill with the design path

Starting Implementation Plan (this skill)
  -> Step 0: Create orchestration todos
    -> [ ] Branch setup
    -> [ ] Create implementation plan
    -> [ ] Re-read skill (restore context)
    -> [ ] Execution handoff

  -> Branch Setup [tracked task]
    -> Ask if user wants worktree
    -> If yes: invoke using-git-worktrees
    -> If no: ask which branch, create if needed

  -> Planning [tracked task wrapping granular tasks]
    -> Invoke writing-implementation-plans
    -> Creates granular tasks per phase (NA, NB, NC, ND)
    -> Creates Finalization task (code review, fix ALL issues)
    -> Write to docs/implementation-plans/

  -> After Planning: Keep Ordering Correct
    -> Move "Re-read skill" after the Finalization task in the todo list
    -> Ensures correct execution order in task list

  -> Restore Context [tracked task, after Finalization]
    -> Re-read this skill
    -> Ensures handoff instructions are accurate post-compaction

  -> Execution Handoff [tracked task]
    -> Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` for absolute paths
    -> Verify plan directory exists
    -> Output message with verified absolute paths
    -> Tell user to start a fresh session (/new)

Execute Implementation Plan (next step)
  -> Reads implementation plan
  -> Implements task-by-task
  -> Code review between tasks
```

**Purpose:** Bridge design and execution with appropriate branch isolation, granular task tracking that survives compaction, and context restoration.
